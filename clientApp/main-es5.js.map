If a deciduous (baby) tooth has too\n        much dental decay to warrant a filling, then a stainless steel crown should be placed. A stainless steel\n        crown is a very durable restoration. Stainless steel crowns are commonly used on deciduous (baby)\n        teeth.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        If the tooth has had a pulpotomy, a stainless steel crown is often placed afterward. Only a stainless\n        steel crown is likely to remain intact for the life of the tooth. Baby teeth which have had pulpotomies\n        tend to become brittle and are more likely to break if a large filling only is placed. Failure rates for\n        stainless steel crowns are less than 1% per year.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Our goal is to achieve the best clinical outcome by using the least invasive treatment and avoid having\n        the patient spend money on a treatment that doesn’t last.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        Stainless steel crowns are <strong>contra-indicated</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        1: if the primary molar is close to exfoliation with more than half the roots resorbed <br>\n        2: in a patient with a known nickel allergy\n    </p>\n    <p>Some parents or patients may complain about the appearance of SSCs.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>What are my alternatives?</strong><br>\n                            As with any dental procedure you can choose not to proceed with care. Of course, that decision has\n        its own set of benefits and risks. The tooth may break and require an extraction. If the tooth is\n        extracted, the remaining teeth may shift and require future orthodontics to reposition the permanent\n        teeth.\n\n    </p>\n\n    <p><strong>Informed Consent:</strong><br>\n        I can read and write English and have been given the opportunity to ask any\n        questions regarding the nature and purpose of the proposed treatment and have received answers to\n        my satisfaction.

I understand the\n                    Denefits and More Mastercard terms\n                    of service and fees. I understand that the amount due is my responsibility and that\n                    insurance is billed\n                    as a courtesy to assist me in paying my obligation. I understand that insurance figures\n                    provided are\n                    estimates only. I understand that this estimate is NOT a guarantee of payment by my\n                    insurance. If the\n                    insurance company pays more, I will receive a refund. If the insurance company pays\n                    less, I will either\n                    receive a bill for the difference, have my credit card on file charged for the amount\n                    owed, or will have\n                    my payment plan extended, whatever the dental practice deems best. I understand that if\n                    my insurance\n                    company fails to pay within 60 days of the claim being submitted, the full amount due is\n                    my\n                    responsibility and I will make payment in full. I understand that the above estimated\n                    fees are based on\n                    my treatment plan as listed above. The treatment plan may change, altering the total\n                    cost of care.
